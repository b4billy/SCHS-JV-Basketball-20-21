# SCHS-JV-Basketball-20-21
Here were my analyses done for the 2020-2021 Season for the Shelby County High School JV Basketball Team

I only had data from the Book (FT throws made and missed and points) as well as data that I tracked during the game (Missed Layups and Turnovers). No other data was availible to me, all opinions are my own based on what I saw live during the game.
