Here were my analyses done for the 2020-2021 Season for the Shelby County High School JV Basketball Team

I only had data from the Book (Made FT, Missed FT, 2 Pointers Made, 3 Pointers Made) as well as data that I tracked during the game (Missed Layups and Turnovers). No other data was availible to me, all opinions are my own based on what I saw live during the game. 

In terms of organization of the files, the MidSeason Report occured before all the dated files. The team only competed in a limited number of games during November and December 2020 due to a COVID-19 outbreak on the Varsity team. The season concluded on February 5, 2021.
