# SCHS JV Basketball 2020-2021 Season

During the 2020-2021 school year, I was at home in Alabama due to the Coronavirus Pandemic. During that time, I had the opportunity to volunteer to keep the scorebook for the high school team I played for. In my spare time, I created scouting reports for the JV coach based on what happened in previous games as well show improvement in our own players. The data availible to me was very limited to what I could keep track of while keeping scores. The statistics I was able to count include Made FT, Missed FT, 2 Pointers Made, 3 Pointers Made, Missed Layups and Turnovers. All non-numeric analyses were based on watching the game live, no film was availible. 

In terms of organization of the files, the MidSeason Report occured before all the dated files. The team only competed in a limited number of games during November and December 2020 due to a COVID-19 outbreak on the Varsity team. The season concluded on February 5, 2021.
